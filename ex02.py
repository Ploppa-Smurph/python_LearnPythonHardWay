# a comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("you can have code like this.") #and the comment after is ignored.

#you can also use a comment to disable or comment out code:
#print('this won't run.') #this line is commented out

print('this will run.')
print('hey # there.') #the # is not ignored because it is in a string
